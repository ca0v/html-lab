    <h1>B Tags</h1>
    <p>
      Below you will find examples for the "B" tags as well as a few others.
    </p>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <!-- 
            Notice above I set base to a dummy child folder.
            This means that the href's below will be relative to that folder.
            So, if I want to go back to the proper folder, I need to use ../, which
            means go up one folder.
         -->
        <li><a href="../index.html">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="../about_a.html">A tags</a></li>
        <li><a href="../about_c.html">C tags</a></li>

      <h2>bdi</h2>
      This would be an example of embedding a right-to-left phrase, if I knew
      one. Hopefully this means hello world in Arabic: <bdi>مرحبا بالعالم</bdi>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>bdo</h2>
      With the &lt;bod&gt; tag will actually reverse the
      <bdo dir="rtl">text</bdo> within it, although in this case I had to add
      the dir="rtl".
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>b, button, blockquote</h2>
      <p>
        Within a paragraph, you can use wrap words in the
        <b>bold (&lt;b&gt;)</b> tag to emphasized them. You can also embed a
        <button>Button</button>, although it is rare to find a button within a
        paragraph tag. Copilot says this about accessibility:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        The <b>bold</b> element is used to indicate that the enclosed text is of
        greater importance than the surrounding text. This is typically rendered
        in bold type.
      </blockquote>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Description List</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>&lt;b&gt;</dt>
        <dd>
          The b tag is used to define bold text. The b tag is written as
          &lt;b&gt; and is closed with &lt;/b&gt;.
        </dd>
        <dt>&lt;button&gt;</dt>
        <dd>
          The button tag is used to define a clickable button. The button tag is
          written as &lt;button&gt; and is closed with &lt;/button&gt;.
        </dd>
        <dt>&lt;blockquote&gt;</dt>
        <dd>
          The blockquote tag is used to define a section that is quoted from
          another source. The blockquote tag is written as &lt;blockquote&gt;
          and is closed with &lt;/blockquote&gt;.
        </dd>
        <dt>&lt;base&gt;</dt>
        <dd>
          The base tag is used to define the base URL/target for all relative
          URLs in a document. The base tag is written as &lt;base&gt; and is
          closed with &lt;/base&gt;.
        </dd>
        <dt>&lt;bdi&gt;</dt>
        <dd>
          The bdi tag is used to isolate a part of text that might be formatted
          in a different direction from other text outside it. The bdi tag is
          written as &lt;bdi&gt; and is closed with &lt;/bdi&gt;.
        </dd>
        <dt>&lt;dbo&gt;</dt>
        <dd>
